## Data:
	This project uses data from collected using direct questionnaires from patients of Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by a doctor. (Islam, MM Faniqul et al. 2020). The data contains 17 attribute features with 520 number of instances and downloaded from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

	### Attribute Features:

		Age: Age of the Patient
		Sex: ([Male/Female])

## Justification:
	According to World Health Organization (W.H.O), Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to serious damage to many body's system, especially the nerves and blood vessels. Diabetes was estimated as the leading cause of death globally in 2016 witnessing increase in global prevalence and mortality rate over the years. 
	Also, the total cost of diabetes diagnosis is said to be increasing as day goes by. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), total cost of diagnosis increased from $245bn in 2012 to $327bn in 2017. This may be a major challenge for would be diabetic patient who have been affected economically and health-wise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical practitoners are already saturated with high number of COVID-19 patients, likely to lead to a more reduced focus on patients with other chronic disease such as Diabetes.
	Early diagnosis of diabetes with minimal contact means will definitly be of help to both the patients and the nations health sector.  


* Tha dataset used is found in the github repository
* The template folder contains the html file
* Procfile and requirement.txt also in the github repository

## Future Work:
* More data fields for wider survey/analysis (nationality, region, race, geography)
* More data provision for types of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational)
